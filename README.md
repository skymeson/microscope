microscope
---

This is a small OSX App I clicked, copied and pasted together. I was making a microscope from a PS3 camera. Getting the camera to work on OSX 10.8 was a bit of a problem. The ofxMacamPs3Eye addon for openframeworks worked just fine. I guess the ps3eye videograbber can easily be replaced to use the app on other systems or cameras.
